# why

according to public use laws ( see google search ) you're allowed to recombine IP with added value before monetization; retard tv is pretty good data for a real time tv-host node with audio and video, plus chat, plus monetization alerts

also it's probably the most criminal or sad place in the universe, especially if you go into discord, the underbellies of twitch; seriously the last mass-shooting in the Western world ( possibly anywhere ) was live streamed on twich, reckful style

object detection with such a wide range of garbage is also not bad for machine vision tagging

and LSTM of chat reveals human characterisics toward various types of tv hosts

# usage

figure out how run.sh works and the rest of the sh files

# prerequisites

- node-js, npm i puppeteer random tmi.js proxy-something(i forogt check the puppet.js file)
- a unix-like shell running bash 3.X for the .sh files to thread correctly, you'll have to learn the syntax for 4.X and 5.X which shouldn't be hard, but i'm leaving it at 3.x for now
- install jq and youtube-dl ( also chromium standalone isn't used for this yet, but you probably want it ) somehow with the unix-like shell ( brew install; sudo apt-get install, etc. )
- python3.7 or 3.8 and pip3 install tcd
- will probably use tempmail and a burner phone service to 2fa everything auto in the next full-day coding session on this garbage, then think about how to start general purpose algorithming the ML extracted from moron website
